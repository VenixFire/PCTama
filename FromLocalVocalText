Which is cool
[BLANK_AUDIO] [LAUGH]
Of course it's going to have homing
That's talking about cookies. This thing wasn't even on when I was talking about cookies
And it put an exclamation point, which is awesome
(laughs)
(laughs)
(laughs)
(laughs) A little bit
It also...
It's definitely not catching everything
but it's
for your fishing
(laughing)
(laughing) Bye
It's doing something
And that's better than it was doing
That right there, it finally caught a whole sentence
[BLANK_AUDIO] Blank audio is crazy
So...
I think it's separating, so it's separating in the file based on...
No, nobody is speaking of foreign language
It's separating on the file based on sentences
Booble!
(laughs) What's booble?
(laughs)
She's a plump baby, she's a good girl She doesn't know, she's not having big bunny babies
Hey, I caught that
It caught a full sentence and it only does that every once in a while
Usually it's like...
Fragments
and that might be because it's catching
only a sentence at a time in the file
Wait, that's another one
Yes, she's a plump baby. She's a good girl. It is catching them. It's just
Weird
Relatable. Yeah, you are
(laughs)
(laughing) What?
Huh?
What?
(laughs)
(laughs)
What? Okay, I'm just gonna...
[BLANK_AUDIO]
She's playing Poi Opoyo
Good. Good. Good
Do I know what it is? No
What are we catching?
Now when your food's for fish and food?
Whoa
This is even further behind the other one
(laughs)
That's really bad
(laughing)
They're cut
Kind of in sync though
- Yes
*cough*
Oh?
Woo
Yes
[SOUND]
[inaudible]
I don't know
Good
Point though
Well, that was weird
Oh, it's not the stream delay. It's not turned on
untrucating that will uh...
Stop the truncation of the sentences
That'd be cool
It's giving a lot more full sentences now
Since I untrunkated it
I don't know what the files are doing then, but...
(groans)
Apparently I laugh a lot, Dad
Yep
Yep, I'm too much hehe
So much he so much how
You didn't even know how he, I'm hot
"What? Nobody was. I didn't know. It was just truncating it."
I'm so sorry
I don't even know
I didn't even know you
For your fishing
That means it'll say it three times because that's the second time I've read it
Um...
[BLANK_AUDIO] Kinda, yeah
Yes
(laughing)
I mean, I do that
(laughs)
When people say what I said back to me
[laughs]
(laughs)
Isn't that the goal kind of?
Mm-hmm
Yup, or else it'll say it again
Thanks
(laughs)
(laughs) I'll read it again
See oh my god blank how to use
Chris!
Easy!
